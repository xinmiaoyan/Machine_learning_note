statsmodels is a statistical analysis package that was seeded by work from Stanford University statistics professor Jonathan Taylor, who implemented a number of regression analysis models popular in the R programming language. Skipper Seabold and Josef Perktold formally created the new statsmodels project in 2010 and since then have grown the project to a critical mass of engaged users and contributors. Nathaniel Smith developed the Patsy project, which provides a formula or model specification framework for statsmodels inspired by Râ€™s formula system.
Compared with scikit-learn, statsmodels contains algorithms for classical (primarily frequentist) statistics and econometrics. This includes such submodules as:
* Regression models: Linear regression, generalized linear models, robust linear models, linear mixed effects models, etc.
* Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
* Time series analysis: AR, ARMA, ARIMA, VAR, and other models
* Nonparametric methods: Kernel density estimation, kernel regression
* Visualization of statistical model results
statsmodels is more focused on statistical inference, providing uncertainty estimates and p-values for parameters. scikit-learn, by contrast, is more prediction-focused.
