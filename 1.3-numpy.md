NumPy, short for Numerical Python, has long been a cornerstone of numerical computing in Python. It provides the data structures, algorithms, and tools needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python. NumPy contains, among other things:

* A fast and efficient multidimensional array object ndarray
* Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays
* Tools for reading and writing array-based datasets to disk
* Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation
* A mature C API to enable Python extensions and native C or C++ code to access NumPy's data structures and computational facilities

Beyond the fast array-processing capabilities that NumPy adds to Python, one of its primary uses in data analysis is as a container for data to be passed between algorithms and libraries. For numerical data, NumPy arrays are more efficient for storing and manipulating data than the other built-in Python data types. Also, libraries written in a lower-level language, such as C or Fortran, can operate on the data stored in a NumPy array without copying data into a separate memory representation. Thus, many numerical computing tools for Python either assume NumPy arrays as a primary data structure or else target seamless interoperability with NumPy.
