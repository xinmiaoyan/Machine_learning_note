SciPy is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem domains in scientific computing. Here is a sampling of the packages included:
#### scipy.integrate
Numerical integration routines and differential equation solvers
#### scipy.linalg
Linear algebra routines and matrix decompositions extending beyond those pro‐ vided in numpy.linalg
#### scipy.optimize
Function optimizers (minimizers) and root finding algorithms
#### scipy.signal
Signal processing tools
#### scipy.sparse
Sparse matrices and sparse linear system solvers
#### scipy.special
Wrapper around SPECFUN, a Fortran library implementing many common mathematical functions, such as the gamma function
#### scipy.stats
Standard continuous and discrete probability distributions (density functions, samplers, continuous distribution functions), various statistical tests, and more descriptive statistics
Together NumPy and SciPy form a reasonably complete and mature computational foundation for many traditional scientific computing applications.
