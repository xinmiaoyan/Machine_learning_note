#### Why Python for Data Analysis?
For many people, the Python programming language has strong appeal. Since its first appearance in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular interpreted pro‐ gramming languages, along with Perl, Ruby, and others. Python and Ruby have become especially popular since 2005 or so for building websites using their numer‐ ous web frameworks, like Rails (Ruby) and Django (Python). Such languages are often called scripting languages, as they can be used to quickly write small programs, or scripts to automate other tasks. I don’t like the term “scripting language,” as it car‐ ries a connotation that they cannot be used for building serious software. Among interpreted languages, for various historical and cultural reasons, Python has developed a large and active scientific computing and data analysis community. In the last 10 years, Python has gone from a bleeding-edge or “at your own risk” scientific com‐ puting language to one of the most important languages for data science, machine learning, and general software development in academia and industry.

For data analysis and interactive computing and data visualization, Python will inevi‐ tably draw comparisons with other open source and commercial programming lan‐ guages and tools in wide use, such as R, MATLAB, SAS, Stata, and others. In recent years, Python’s improved support for libraries (such as pandas and scikit-learn) has made it a popular choice for data analysis tasks. Combined with Python’s overall strength for general-purpose software engineering, it is an excellent option as a pri‐ mary language for building data applications.

#### Installation and Setup

Windows

```bash
C:\Users\wesm>python
Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.1.1 (64-bit)| (default, Jul  5 2016, 11:41:13)
[MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
>>>
```

Apple (OS X, macOS)
Download the OS X Anaconda installer, which should be named something like Anaconda3-4.1.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg. Double-click the .pkg file to run the installer. When the installer runs, it automatically appends the Anaconda executable path to your .bash_profile file. This is located at /Users/$USER/.bash_profile.
To verify everything is working, try launching IPython in the system shell (open the Terminal application to get a command prompt):
```bash
$ ipython
```
To exit the shell, press Ctrl-D or type exit() and press Enter.


GNU/Linux
Linux details will vary a bit depending on your Linux flavor, but here I give details for such distributions as Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora. Setup is similar to OS X with the exception of how Anaconda is installed. The installer is a shell script that must be executed in the terminal. Depending on whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit system, you will either need to install the x86 (32-bit) or x86_64 (64-bit) installer. You will then have a file named something similar to Anaconda3-4.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh. To install it, execute this script with bash:
```bash
$ bash Anaconda3-4.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

After accepting the license, you will be presented with a choice of where to put the Anaconda files. I recommend installing the files in the default location in your home directory—for example, /home/$USER/anaconda (with your username, naturally).
The Anaconda installer may ask if you wish to prepend its bin/ directory to your $PATH variable. If you have any problems after installation, you can do this yourself by modifying your .bashrc (or .zshrc, if you are using the zsh shell) with something akin to:
```bash
export PATH=/home/$USER/anaconda/bin:$PATH
```

After doing this you can either start a new terminal process or execute your .bashrc again with source ~/.bashrc.
