Since the project’s inception in 2010, scikit-learn has become the premier general- purpose machine learning toolkit for Python programmers. In just seven years, it has had over 1,500 contributors from around the world. It includes submodules for such models as:
* Classification: SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, etc.
* Regression: Lasso, ridge regression, etc.
* Clustering: k-means, spectral clustering, etc.
* Dimensionality reduction: PCA, feature selection, matrix factorization, etc.
* Model selection: Grid search, cross-validation, metrics
* Preprocessing: Feature extraction, normalization
Along with pandas, statsmodels, and IPython, scikit-learn has been critical for ena‐ bling Python to be a productive data science programming language.
